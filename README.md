About Medic OS
==============

Medic OS is a size-optimized Linux-based operating system, designed specifically
for Medic Mobile's distributed web applications. It currently runs on VMware,
VirtualBox, Hyper-V, Xen (including Amazon EC2 and Openstack), and Linux
chroot/container environments. A port for ARM v6 and ARM v7 machines (such
as the Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black) is in progress.

Medic OS provides a Busybox-based userspace environment, Erlang runtime,
CouchDB, Node.js, OpenSSH, a Java runtime environment, couchdb-lucene, Gammu,
gammu-json, and a number of other smaller utilities and modules. The full
compressed Medic OS distribution is less than one hundred megabytes.

Downloading Medic OS
====================

Unsupported (read: alpha) test builds are currently available at
http://dev.medicmobile.org/downloads/medic-os. This section will be updated when
a supported release is available. For more information, please contact Medic Mobile
at http://medicmobile.org.

Using Medic OS
==============

Instance Creation (ISO)
-----------------------

Once you have an ISO image in hand, you can:

1. Boot the ISO in a virtual machine. VMware Player, Workstation, and Fusion are
   fully supported; Virtualbox and Hyper-V lack GSM modem features but are otherwise
   supported.

2. Point your browser the the virtual machine's IP address, which should be displayed
    on the virtual machine console. If your DNS resolver supports mDNS (Bonjour, Zeroconf),
    you should be able to visit `http://medic.local` instead of the IP address.

3. Complete the in-browser setup steps, and wait for services to start up.

4. Click _Finish_, then log in to the application using your credentials from step three.


Administrative Access
---------------------

System-level administrative access to a running copy of Medic OS is available via SSH
on port 33696. In ISO distributions, SSH password authentication is available by default;
the administrative user name is `vm`, and the password is identical to what was set in
step three above.

If you are a developer, have physical access to the virtual machine console, and are
attempting to troubleshoot an issue that has rendered the virtual machine inaccessible,
switch to virtual terminal six to regain access.


Building Medic OS
=================

Linux
-----

To ensure a successful build, check to make sure you have the following software
available at compilation time:

  * Linux kernel version 3.10 or higher
  * Version 2.69 or higher of `autoconf`

Check out a copy of the Medic OS source repository:

```shell
git clone 'https://github.com/medic/medic-os.git'
```

Ensure that you're running Amazon Linux or Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Other
Redhat-like and Debian-like distributions are known to work, but are
not officially supported. Slackware works (and tagfiles are provided),
but you may need to manually upgrade `automake` and/or `autoconf`.

Run the distribution-specific dependency installation script for your
operating system. These scripts are interactive, and will require you to
confirm modifications. On Redhat-like operating systems, use:

```shell
sudo ./medic-os/platform/config/redhat/scripts/prepare-system
```

On Debian-like operating systems, use:

```shell
sudo ./medic-os/platform/config/debian/scripts/prepare-system
```

Next, install the appropriate Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and
Java Development Kit (JDK) beneath `medic-os`. To make this easier, we
provide prepackaged JDK/JRE archives. On 64-bit Intel systems, run:

```shell
file='medic-os-java-x64-latest.tar.xz' &&
curl -LO# "https://medic-mobile.s3.amazonaws.com/medic-os/build/source/$file" &&
tar -xvJf "$file"
```

On 32-bit Intel systems, run the same commands, but replace the first line with:

```shell
file='medic-os-java-x86-latest.tar.xz'
```

Finally, download source code for every component of Medic OS, then
immediately start the build process, all in one shot:

```shell
cd medic-os && sudo make
```

Mac OS X
--------

**Warning**: Developers only.

Ensure that you have the necessary build-time dependencies. There is
currently no definitive list for Mac OS X, but dependencies are
documented for Redhat-like and Debian-like Linux distributions. A
Homebrew or Fink environment with a working GCC toolchain should get you
close. (Issue: https://github.com/medic/medic-os/issues/43)

Check out a copy of the Medic OS source repository:

```shell
git clone 'https://github.com/medic/medic-os.git'
```

Download source code for every component of Medic OS – this may take
some time on a slow connection. This must be done as root currently, but
we're working to remove this requirement in a future version:

```shell
cd medic-os && sudo make download
```

Start the build process. The following command builds a supported subset
of Medic OS – specifically, the `medic-core` package – but not entire
operating system images or containers. This mode of use is intended for
developers and/or testers, and is not suitable for production
environments:

```shell
cd platform/source/medic-core &&
  sudo make ROOT=/srv/software/medic-core/v1.6.1/x64
```

We recommend doing this in a `screen` session, as it can take 60-90
minutes to complete even on modern hardware.

When the build process is finished, you'll need to modify your `PATH`
and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables to point to the new files.
If you'd rather not do this manually, try running the following:

```shell
source medic-os/platform/initrd/common/boot/include/utility &&
prepend_paths /srv/software/medic-core/v1.6.1/x64
```

To start CouchDB as an unprivileged user, you currently need to modify
the ownership of a few directories. This will be automated in a future
release:

```shell
prefix='/srv/software/medic-core/v1.6.1/x64' &&
for dir in var/log var/lib var/run etc; do
  sudo chown -R "`id -un`:`id -gn`" "$prefix/$dir/couchdb";
done
```
